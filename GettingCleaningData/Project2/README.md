# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project 2
## README
===
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate our ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.


The dataset includes the following files:
===

- "README.md"

- "CodeBook.md": describes the modus operandi of the "run_analysis.R" script.

- "run_analysis.R": R script converting the train and test sets into a tidy data set.

- "tidy_data_set.txt": tidy data set saved into a space-delimited text file, including column names, excluding row indices.

The dataset relies on the following files (NOT included in the dataset):
===

- "train/X_train.txt": Training set.

- "train/y_train.txt": Training labels.

- "train/subject_train.txt": Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity in the train sample - its range is from 1 to 30.

- "test/X_test.txt": Test set.

- "test/y_test.txt": Test labels.

- "test/subject_test.txt": Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity in the test sample - its range is from 1 to 30.

- "features.txt": List of all features.

- "activity_labels.txt": Links the class labels with their activity name.
